## To-do
1. Create a branch to follow the rebuild gude. This will solve the issue of having a big array within the main bot file. 
2. Get Heroku to give me more information about each build. Like printing build time. Maybe this should actually be a function of the bot. Maybe it should tell me when it's been rebuilt and can accept new commands. 
3. Find new commands to program!
